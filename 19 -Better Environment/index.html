1. Install Node

2. npm = node package manager, npx = node package execute (execute any javascript package without even installing it)


4. install tailwindcss/creating node modules folder = npm i -D tailwindcss (i= install, D = Developer Dependency, not for production)

5. Creating Config File = npx tailwindcss init

6. Locating Files Containing Tailwind = config file -> content object edit like ./*.html

7. Create input folder to put the directives of base, component and utilities

8. Writing script for input and outpit file in package.json = like in script : "build" = "tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./styles/tailwind.css", "watch" = "tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./styles/tailwind.css -watch"

9. Now, we can use this command = npm run build (It will automatically create the output folder and file like styles-tailwind.css), npm run watch

10. Create the html file and link it with output css in link tag.

11. npm run watch

12. If you want to write custom css styles for specific class/tag, use @layer directive. In layer directive, also can use @apply to use existing tailwind class. It solves the problem of so many classes or repeating classes in html file.

13. We can configure our own style in configuration file and can use it.

14. We can use media screen function.

15. Optional PostCSS and WebPack
